# AI Integration Points for Mini-Course Creator

This document outlines potential integration points for AI features within the existing Mini-Course Creator tool, based on user requirements and code review.

## 1. Course Structure & Workflow Suggestions

*   **Location:** Course Editor (New Course/Module/Lesson creation areas).
*   **Functionality:** 
    *   AI suggests module and lesson structures based on a user-provided course topic or learning objective.
    *   Provide specialized AI-suggested templates for specific topics like "Workflow Automation", aligning with user interest in supporting AI automation classes and exercises (e.g., identifying automation opportunities).
*   **Trigger:** "Suggest Structure with AI" button.
*   **Relevant Requirements:** Workflow suggestion, AI automation class support.

## 2. Content Generation Assistance

*   **Location:** Lesson Editor (Text block, Quiz block).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Text Blocks:** AI generates draft text content based on lesson title/prompt, adhering to bite-sized best practices.
    *   **Quiz Blocks:** AI generates relevant quiz questions (MCQ/T/F) and answers based on lesson content or title.
*   **Trigger:** "AI Generate Content" / "AI Generate Quiz" buttons within respective block editors.
*   **Relevant Requirements:** AI generating course content, assisting the creator.

## 3. Best Practice Guidance Enhancement

*   **Location:** Course Settings (Outcome, Audience), Text/Video blocks.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   AI analyzes user input for Learning Outcome and Target Audience, suggesting improvements for specificity and clarity (BP#1, BP#2).
    *   AI analyzes text content for conciseness (BP#3) or suggests simplification/summarization.
*   **Trigger:** "AI Suggest Improvement" / "AI Analyze Content" buttons near relevant fields/editors.
*   **Relevant Requirements:** AI as a suggestion engine, reinforcing best practices.

## 4. Interactive AI-Powered Explanations

*   **Location:** Editor interface (near tooltips/help icons), potentially in the learner view.
*   **Functionality:** Replace or augment static tooltips. Clicking a 'Learn More' or help icon triggers an AI-powered popup providing dynamic, context-aware explanations, examples, or elaborations related to the specific feature or best practice.
*   **Trigger:** Clicking designated icons/buttons.
*   **Relevant Requirements:** Interactive format, popup information, enhancing 'Learn More'.

## 5. Image Concept Suggestions

*   **Location:** Lesson Editor (Image block).
*   **Functionality:** Based on surrounding lesson content, AI suggests relevant image themes, keywords, or concepts for the user to find/create visuals. Could potentially integrate with image generation later.
*   **Trigger:** "AI Suggest Image Concept" button within the Image block editor.
*   **Relevant Requirements:** Assisting the creator, potentially enhancing media (BP#6).

## Notes:

*   The implementation should consider the existing Flask backend and potentially integrate with external AI APIs.
*   Frontend changes will be needed to add AI trigger buttons and display suggestions/generated content.
*   The revised React/Tailwind homepage design needs to be integrated or adapted for the Flask application's templating system (likely Jinja2).
