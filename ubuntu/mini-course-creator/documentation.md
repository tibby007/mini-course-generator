Clicking "Create New Course" on the Dashboard instantly creates a blank course structure and takes you directly to the Course Editor for that new course.

## 4. The Course Editor Interface

The editor is divided into two main sections:

*   **Left Panel (Structure Panel):** This panel shows the overall structure of your course (Settings, Introduction, Modules, Lessons, Conclusion). You can click on any item here to load its details into the right panel for editing. You can also add new modules and lessons, and reorder or delete existing ones using the buttons provided.
*   **Right Panel (Editor Panel):** This is where you edit the details of the item selected in the left panel. The content of this panel changes depending on whether you've selected Course Settings, Introduction, a Module, a Lesson, or the Conclusion.

When you first create a course or click "Course Settings" in the structure panel, the right panel shows:

*   **Course Title:** The main title for your mini-course.
*   **Course Description:** A brief overview of what the course is about.
*   **Learning Outcome (Mandatory - BP#1):** This is crucial. Define the *single, specific, actionable* thing a learner will be able to *do* after completing your course. Use the tooltip (?) for guidance and the character counter to keep it concise.
*   **Target Audience (BP#2):** Briefly describe who this course is for. What's their current knowledge level? What goal do they want to achieve? Use the tooltip (?) for guidance.
